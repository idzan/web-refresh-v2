            <h2>4. DO WE USE COOKIES OR TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
            <p>We may use cookies to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is listed below.</p>
            <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
            <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their webSite work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
            <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Marko Idzan) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other webSite.</p>
            <h3>Why do we use cookies?</h3>
            <p>We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our WebSite to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our WebSite for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</p>
            <h3>How can I control cookies?</h3>
            <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.</p>
            <p>The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the footer of our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.</p>
            <p>In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> or <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youronlinechoices.com</a>.</p>

            <h2>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
            <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Site is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment. </p>

            <h2>7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
            <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Site, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Site. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:gdpr@idzan.eu">gdpr@idzan.eu</a>.</p>

            <h2>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
            <p>In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
            <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal.</p>
            <p>If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p>

If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>
            <p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Site, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Site.

            <h2>11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?</h2>
            <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.
